1. two ways to check behavoirs:

A1: recorde a bag whiling moving the robot using moveit, 
	rosbag record -O bag_name.bag  /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
				       /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
			               /arm_controller/state
				       /joint_states
A2: use the bag_data_process package to plot different topics:
	rosrun bag_data_process plot_traj_goal_states.py bag_name.bag
it will plot joints state, desired (interpolated) positions, velocitices, and accelerations generated by the controller.
it plots the dervative of the desired positions to check jerk limits.


B: you can check the interpolated positions generated by the controller using the bezier_test_pkg:
	rosrun bezier_test_pkg bezier_from_msg_online_test
this node receives online the FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal generated by moveit and
then it overwrite times, vel, acc and then uses bezier equation to interpolate the waypoints, and 
then it plot pos, vel, acc, jrk.
